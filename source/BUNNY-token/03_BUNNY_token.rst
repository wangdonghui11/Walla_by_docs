Presale
===========
- Wallaby token

The Wallab ytoken doesn’t have a max supply. For every 1 HT earned in the performance fees, 5 Wallaby minted, so supply is not capped at the moment. We may establish new strategies to limit the cap or burn some tokens, however currently we are focused on the growth of the Wallaby token. You can earn Wallaby using the farms, or you can buy Wallaby through our zap function. Roughly 13% of all Wallaby mints will go towards development to ensure rapid innovation.

  - Honest $MDX Farmers: Deposit MDX-WHT LP and reap the benefits of the compounding effect. With Simple Interest, the APY is 150% for MDX-WHT, however, if this gets compounded it becomes 347% APY. The assumptions are the following: 1) initial capital is $1m, 2) transaction cost: $1, 3)Compounded Once Daily. The transaction cost assumes it takes 4-5 steps for Wallaby to compound deposits. Around 25% of Wallaby’s profits will be bonuses. Some percent of the farming profits will be saved as HT in the Wallaby Reward Pool.

  - Degens: Buy Wallaby at the start of launch. Sell when the price becomes high enough to fulfill your greedy desire. The Probability of Wallaby dropping below the initial price of $3 is very low. 1) Presale Participants bought Wallabyat $3 and will not sell below that price at a loss. 2) As Wallaby Price goes up, Wallabyissued volume will decrease.

  - Smart Investors: Stake Wallaby long-term. The APY of Wallaby Pool is amazing and real! The meaning of Wallaby Pool’s APY 100% is if you buy $10 worth of Wallabynow and stake it for 1 year, you will receive $10 worth of HT. If you sell the remaining Wallaby on the market, you can also capitalize on profits there. If you are a wise investor, you would meticulously analyze the APY of the staking pool and earn profits not only from the HTrewards, but also from selling the Wallabyas well.

  - We are starting off with the following fee structure:

    - 30% Performance fee

    - 0.5% withdrawal fee if withdrawal happens within 72 hours of deposit

    - For further clarification the 30% performance fee is collected and given to the Wallaby stakers. For every 1 HT earned through performance fees, 10 Wallabyis minted and given to respective users. So long as the price of Wallaby stays above 1HT/10, users are actually earning money through this performance fee system. All of these fees will ultimately go towards staking Wallaby, thereby ensuring the sustainability and longevity of our project and benefitting Wallabysupporters/holders.
