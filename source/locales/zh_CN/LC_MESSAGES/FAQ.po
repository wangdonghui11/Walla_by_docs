"Wallaby is a new and rapidly growing DeFi yield aggregator that is used "
"for MDXSwap. The Wallaby protocol empowers farmers to leverage their "
"yield-seeking tendencies to optimize yield compounding strategy on HECO. "
"We are providing strategies for the various needs of farmers from the "
"highest yield seekers to the risk reward optimizing smart investors."

msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:11
msgid ""
"We wanted to create a platform that automatically compounds yields for "
"all individuals, no matter how small your stake may be. Our goal is to "
"expand the DeFi ecosystem, specifically on the Huobi ECO Chain, while "
"providing users with various strategies to maximize returns while "
"minimizing risk."

msgid "How do Wallaby Farms Work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:15
msgid ""
"Currently, the majority of our farms are those that exist on Mdex Swap. "
"Essentially the farms on our platform get permission from individuals via"
" smart contracts to automatically compound and reinvest yields on behalf "
"of individuals."

msgid "Can’t I just compound by myself?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:19
msgid ""
"Compounding yourself on MdexSwap is a very tedious process and it is "
"often hard to know the optimal frequency and timing of when to compound "
"and reinvest your yields. Wallaby does all of this for you plus saves you"
" gas fees."

msgid "What is the Wallaby Token?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:23
msgid ""
"Wallaby Token is our native governance token. Wallaby holders govern our "
"ecosystem and receive the majority of farm performance fee profits. "
"Holding/Staking Wallaby is not only beneficial for individual profits, "
"but also ensures the Wallaby Ecosystem runs smoothly."

msgid "Which Wallaby Farm do I pick?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:27
msgid ""
"Every Farm requires a different LP Token. Furthermore the different Farms"
" represent different risk tolerances for Wallaby users. A high APY "
"usually means more volatility in the underlying token price. For example,"
" HUSD-USDT has a much lower compounded APY than MDX-WHT, since HUSD is a "
"stable coin which is pegged to the dollar and does not experience "
"volatility."

msgid "Systematic Risk"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:33

"The Systematic Risk would be the decrease of monetary value of assets "

"The Idiosyncratic Risk would be risks associated with our actual project."
" Although our code has been audited by Haechi Labs, there are always "
"risks that projects will fall victim to malicious hackers. That being "
"said, our Wallaby developers account for the security risks of smart "
"contracts and only will interact with contracts that meet the security "
"threshold."

"Because the APY is constantly changing on MdexSwap, the Compounded APY on"
" the Wallaby Platform is constantly changing. Furthermore, because this "
"APY is calculated via compounded (exponential growth), it cannot be "
"calculated in a linear manner (i.e. APY/365) So long as you hold your "
"tokens in our farms for an extended period of time, your assets will "
"continue to grow exponentially."

msgid ""
"Currently all the farms get compounded except for the Wallaby Staking "

msgid "Withdrawal Fee"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:63
msgid ""
"There is a 0.5% withdrawal fee from Farms only if withdrawal happens "
"within 72 hours of deposit. This fee exists to maintain the smooth flow "
"of the ecosystem and to prevent possible exploitation from individuals "
"acting under bad faith. For example if there was no 0.5% withdrawal fee "
"within the 72 hours, someone could keep depositing right before the "
"compounding takes place and withdraw right after and still reap the same "
"benefits and continuous long-term holders."

"We have a 30% performance fee on our farms, but the majority of the "

msgid "Why are the transaction fees so high?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:75
msgid ""
"High fee is because withdrawing it’s not just one transaction. With one "

"Yes, Haechi Labs has completed the first audit. The results were "
"extremely positive! The audit highlighted no critical or major issues, "

msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:114
msgid ""
"Let’s assume the APR of the MDX farm is 365%. This means that on average "
"if we divide 365% by 365 days, we get a daily return of 1%. Now since "
"Wallaby compounds this 1%, we can estimate the compounded APR using the "
"following calculation: (1+0.01)^365 - 1 = 3678% Keep in mind that this is"
" an assumption that only holds true if the APR of MDX farm stays constant"
" through one year. However, this is obviously not the case since the APY "
"also changes by the second. We can use the same calculation for the rest "
"of the Farms as well! Just divide the APR by 365, which would be the "
"average daily yield. (1+daily yield)^365 -1 = Compounded APY."
msgstr ""

#: ../../FAQ/07_FAQ.rst:116
msgid ""
"The new maximizer farms put the daily yields from the Farms, into the MDX"
" compounding pools. The Stable Coin-HT Farms have a current APY of 30%, "
"but if we use the maximizer farms the APY increases to about 150%. This "
"strategy is truly unique and advantageous since the principal investment "
"does not get touched, and only the extra yields from the farm get "
"invested in the more volatile, high risk-high reward MDX pool."
