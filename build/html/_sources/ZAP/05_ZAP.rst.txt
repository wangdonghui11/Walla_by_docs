ZAP
====

The Zap feature we added essentially allows for a user to directly switch from single asset (HT) to an LP Token (HT-MDX LP), with just a click of a button without having to go to panMDX swap and switch out different assets. Users can also just switch between different assets, for example, HT to Wallaby. There is no additional fee for this zap; we built this tool for the convenience of users.
