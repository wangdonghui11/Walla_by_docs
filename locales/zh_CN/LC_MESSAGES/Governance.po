"Wallaby holders control the ecosystem and receive the majority of farm "
"performance fee profits. In order to claim these profits, Wallaby holders"
" stake their tokens in the Wallaby Governance Pool. Profits are sent to "
"this pool in the form of HT rewards. The amount of profits you receive is"
" determined by the number of Wallaby tokens you stake (% of the pool) you"
" own. We currently have a snapshot voting page where users can use "
"Wallaby to vote on decisions within our community. Thus the more Wallaby "
"you stake, the higher your influence in the ecosystem. In the future, we "
"expect to come up with a more concrete governance tokenomics ecosystem, "
"perhaps by introducing a new, separate governance token."
