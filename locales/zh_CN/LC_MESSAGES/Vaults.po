"In this farm, users can stake using their Wallaby tokens, while getting "
"back WHT. The APR for this farm is dependent on the performance of all "

" collected and given out as the reward/roi for the Wallabystaking pool. "
"Wallaby Pool has no withdrawal fee and no performance fee."

"Currently we have Wallaby-WHT，MDX-WHT ,HBTC-WHT, ETH-WHT pools, which "
"exist on MDXswap. Our smart contracts automatically compound your "
"investments, giving you a higher APY. For these pools, as profit you will"
" be getting the respective LP Token of the pool, as well as Wallaby "
"tokens. 30% of profits will be collected and given as Wallaby tokens. For"
" every 1HT collected, we give 10 Wallaby. There should be a withdrawal "
"fee of 0.5% if withdrawn within 72 hours. Currently you can only claim "
"your profits, if you claim & exit the pool. We may change this in the "
"future."

"The Maximizer farms takes the profits that come out of the original "
"compounded MDXswap farm, and puts it into the MDX auto-compounding farm, "
"in order to give you a higher apy, while protecting your principal. There"
" should be a withdrawal fee of 0.5% if withdrawn within 72 hours. With "
"the Maximizer Farms, users can claim their profits, without exiting the "
"farm."

"According to our test calculations, assuming that MDX price stays "
"constant, USDT-HT Farm APY is 30%, and MDX APR is 300%, then the APY of "
"someone who deposits into the “Yield Maximizing USDT-HT Farm” would be "
"189.9%. This is much higher than the 30% achieved by simply compounding "
"USDT-HT, yet the risk is very minimal. The only risks would be if MDX "
"price drops significantly, or if the MDX APR drops as well. That being "
"said even if the MDX price drops significantly the principal amount "
"invested in USDT and HT would still be the same. Similar to our regular "
"farms, in order to fully benefit from the compounding effect, a user must"
" have the patience to sit back and watch their money grow exponentially "
"over time. One small complication is that because of the way the new "
"yield maximized farms are coded through back end development, the yields "
"earned daily (24 hour period) get distributed the next day on a rolling "
"cycle. This means that users who deposit from day 0 to day 1 would be at "
"a slight disadvantage as they would not be able to receive their fair "
"share of yields for the first 24 hours. To mitigate this effect we plan "
"on giving these early users some Wallaby to compensate for the lost "
"yields. The graph below illustrates the difference in returns between the"
" original Stable-HT farm and the new Yield Maximizing Stable-HT farm."
