"The Wallab ytoken doesn’t have a max supply. For every 1 HT earned in the"
" performance fees, 5 Wallaby minted, so supply is not capped at the "
"moment. We may establish new strategies to limit the cap or burn some "
"tokens, however currently we are focused on the growth of the Wallaby "
"token. You can earn Wallaby using the farms, or you can buy Wallaby "
"through our zap function. Roughly 13% of all Wallaby mints will go "
"towards development to ensure rapid innovation."

"Honest $MDX Farmers: Deposit MDX-WHT LP and reap the benefits of the "
"compounding effect. With Simple Interest, the APY is 150% for MDX-WHT, "
"however, if this gets compounded it becomes 347% APY. The assumptions are"
" the following: 1) initial capital is $1m, 2) transaction cost: $1, "
"3)Compounded Once Daily. The transaction cost assumes it takes 4-5 steps "
"for Wallaby to compound deposits. Around 25% of Wallaby’s profits will be"
" bonuses. Some percent of the farming profits will be saved as HT in the "
"Wallaby Reward Pool."

"Smart Investors: Stake Wallaby long-term. The APY of Wallaby Pool is "
"amazing and real! The meaning of Wallaby Pool’s APY 100% is if you buy "
"$10 worth of Wallabynow and stake it for 1 year, you will receive $10 "
"worth of HT. If you sell the remaining Wallaby on the market, you can "
"also capitalize on profits there. If you are a wise investor, you would "
"meticulously analyze the APY of the staking pool and earn profits not "
"only from the HTrewards, but also from selling the Wallabyas well."
